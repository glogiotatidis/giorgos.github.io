            <p>I like to self-host services to make things fit my needs instead of the other
way around and to satisfy my need to control my data. Also remember that self
hosting is really important for the health of the open web and internet.</p>
<p>There are a couple of options for self-hosted media servers. I always go for
FLOSS solutions, so <a href="https://plex.tv/">Plex</a> and friends are not an option. A
couple of years ago I tried <a href="http://subsonic.org/">Subsonic</a>, including the
<a href="http://madsonic.org/">MadSonic</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/hakko/musiccabinet">Musicabinet</a> forks. Subsonic looked
really outdated at that time, so that didn't last long. Musicabinet was second
in my evaluation and it looked really promising. It had an automatic radio
station generation from local content and included last.fm information to your
library. A feature particularly useful for explorations in huge libraries shared
between friends. Unfortunately Musicabinet was abandoned by its creator and
eventually started to show its age. Last came MadSonic which is probably the
most feature full and actively developed Subsonic fork to the day.</p>
<p>All these shared the same problem: A heavy java-based codebase with a ton of
features and a horrible user experience. And all I needed was a backend to
stream music to my laptop and mainly to my Android phone. </p>
<p>Since there is a great app for Subsonic on Android
(<a href="https://github.com/daneren2005/Subsonic">DSub</a>) it sounded like I needed an
app with a Subsonic compatible API.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="http://ampache.org/">Ampache</a> which offers a Subsonic API along with
its own, but I was unimpressed. Huge codebase, horrible UX now in PHP. In any
case you're interested I created a
<a href="https://github.com/glogiotatidis/ampache-docker">docker image for ampache</a> as
well.</p>
<p>And then I discovered <a href="https://github.com/spl0k/supysonic/">supysonic</a> a python
implementation of Subsonic's API with transcoding support, which is really
important for mobile streaming. </p>
<p>Since supysonic only implements the API it's super simple. There's only a
minimal web interface for configuration and basic links to players. Music
catalog scanning is blazing fast too because supysonic doesn't mess with your
library. It will only read metadata, make no stupid decisions about your library
and will even server cover.jpg if it exists. I keep my library clean and tidy
with <a href="http://beets.io/">Beets</a> which holds the crown of the single source of
truth for my music collection.</p>
<p>DSub connects, reads and streams the database successfully. While you can setup
maximum bit-rate on DSub itself, you'll need to connect to supysonic's web
interface to configure transcoding formats to fit your needs.</p>
<p>I created a Docker Image for supysonic and you can get started within 10
minutes. Just clone the repo at
<a href="https://github.com/glogiotatidis/supysonic-docker">github.com/glogiotatidis/supysonic-docker</a> and follow the <a href="https://github.com/glogiotatidis/supysonic-docker/blob/master/README.md">instructions</a>.</p>
